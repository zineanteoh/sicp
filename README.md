# SICP
 SICP (Structure and Intepretation of Computer Programs) is a Computer Science textbook by MIT professors Harold Abelson & Gerald Jay Sussman with Julie Sussman. 
 
 This book is also notoriously known as a masterpiece and "the Wizard Book in hacker culture."
 
# Journey
 
 November 27th 2020 marks the day I embark on a journey to explore SICP. 
 
 On that day, I installed [DrRacket](http://racket-lang.org/) as my programming environment and typed out my first line with Racket, the Scheme dialect of [Lisp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language)). 
 
```Scheme
(display "Hello World")
(define (square x) (* x x))
```

 As I go through the SICP book, my habit is to 
 * Highlight key ideas & take note on important concepts 
 * Replicate confusing code on DrRacket & mess around until I 'get it'
 * Jot down moments where I experience eureka or get mindblowned by the authors.
